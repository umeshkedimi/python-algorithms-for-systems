# python-algorithms-for-systems

## Purpose

This repository documents my Python-first discipline in data structures and algorithms, focused on engineering fundamentals rather than competitive programming.

The goal is to strengthen system-level thinking — writing code that is predictable, performant, readable, and scalable.

This work directly supports backend, platform, and AI systems engineering.

## Philosophy

This repository follows a few strict principles:

- Python only — clean, idiomatic, production-style Python
- Pattern-based learning, not problem memorization
- Time and space complexity awareness in every solution
- Clarity over cleverness
- Algorithms as tools for real systems, not puzzles

Problems may start simple and progress gradually — intentionally.

Strong systems are built on strong fundamentals.

## What This Is (and Is Not)

### This is:
- A structured DSA discipline
- An engineering-first approach to algorithms
- Focused on backend, infrastructure, and AI platform use cases
- Written with senior-level clarity and explanations

### This is not:
- Competitive programming
- Code golfing
- Language hopping
- Blind LeetCode grinding

├── arrays/
├── hashing/
├── stack/
├── queue/
├── trees/
├── graphs/

├── dp/
└── notes/
└── patterns.md


Each folder contains:
- Clearly named problems
- Clean Python implementations
- Inline comments explaining why, not just what
- Time and space complexity notes

## How to Read This Repository

- Start from arrays and move upward
- Observe patterns, not just solutions
- Pay attention to trade-offs and constraints
- Ask where this would appear in real systems

---

## Why This Matters

Data structures and algorithms are not just for interviews.

They are fundamental to:
- API performance
- Caching and rate limiting
- Scheduling and prioritization
- Dependency resolution
- Incident analysis
- Large-scale system design

This repository is a long-term investment in engineering clarity.
